#Web app for taking notes during courses/labs

Developing a web app that allows students to take notes during courses/labs.

#Description

The application must allow students to organise their notes by classes they attend and individual study activities.

The platform is based on a Single Page Application architecture. It will be accessible on a desktop, mobile or tablet browser (depending on user preferences).

The note editor should be easy to use so that the student can take notes during the class. It will implement a markdown sistem to allow simple text formatting.
